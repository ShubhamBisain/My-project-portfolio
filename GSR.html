    <h1>Galvanic Lie detector: skin response using LM358</h1>
    
    <p class="objective">
      Project Objective:
    </p>

    <p>
     This galvanic skin response project uses an LM358 configured as a comparator to translate small changes in skin resistance into a clear logic‑level indication that can drive LEDs and a transistor output stage.
    </p>
  

    <p class="objective">
        Project Overview:
    </p>

    <p>
        The circuit forms a voltage divider with the subject’s skin resistance and a reference resistor so that any change in skin conductance directly shifts the divider output voltage. This divider voltage is fed into one input of the LM358 while a potentiometer‑set reference voltage is applied to the other input, defining the decision threshold between “truth” and “lie” states.
      </p> 

      <p>
        In this project, the LM324 expands the single LM358 threshold into multiple levels, while the NPN transistors act as current amplifiers and switches to drive the LED indicators without loading the comparator outputs
    </p>

    <p class="objective">
     LM358 comparator function:

    <p>
        In comparator mode, the LM358 compares the instantaneous skin voltage from the divider with the adjustable reference; when the skin resistance drops (higher conductance from stress), the divider voltage crosses the threshold and the LM358 output saturates toward the supply rail. By tuning the potentiometer, the threshold can be calibrated to the nominal skin resistance of the subject so the circuit is sensitive to relative changes rather than absolute values. 
    </p>

    <p class="objective">
      Signal conditioning and indication:
    </p>

    <p>
      The LM358 output drives an NPN transistor, which in turn powers an LED or LED bar segment block so that small analog variations in skin resistance become a robust visual indication that is not heavily loaded by the comparator itself. Additional comparator channels and LEDs in the schematic create multiple “levels” of response, allowing the circuit to show gradations of arousal instead of a single binary output.
    </p>
    <p class="objective">
      Function of the NPN transistors:
    </p>

    <p>
      Each NPN transistor takes a low‑current logic signal from a comparator output (LM358 or LM324) and switches a higher LED current from VCC through the collector–emitter path, protecting the op‑amp/comparator from overcurrent and providing clear on/off indication.​
    </p>
    <p>
      The transistor stage also isolates the sensitive skin‑signal and reference network from load variations, so changes in LED current do not disturb the comparator thresholds or the voltage divider that senses skin resistance.
    </p>
    <p class="objective">
      Function of the LM324
    </p>
    <p>
      The LM324 provides four comparator channels; in this circuit, its inputs are tied to different reference levels and to the conditioned skin‑voltage, so each channel trips at a different skin‑resistance value, creating a multi‑segment “stress level” bar with several LEDs.
    </p>

    <p>
      By carefully choosing the reference voltages (via resistor networks or potentiometers), the LM324 stages grade the response: lower comparators light the first LEDs for small conductance changes, while higher‑threshold comparators activate additional LEDs and transistors as the galvanic skin response increases.

      Summary about this project:
    </p>
    <p class="objective">
      This galvanic skin response project measures changes in skin resistance with a voltage divider and compares them against adjustable thresholds using LM358 and LM324 op‑amps in comparator mode. The LM358 implements the primary “truth/lie” decision, while the LM324 adds multiple comparison levels to show graded stress via several LEDs. NPN transistors buffer the comparator outputs and switch the LED currents so the visual indication is strong and stable without disturbing the sensitive measurement network.
